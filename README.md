# ðŸ§  ASD_Diagnosis_App

This repository contains the source code developed for the thesis:  
**"Machine Learning and Computer Vision for Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Diagnosis"**.

It includes two main components:
- âœ… **Machine Learning (ML)** models trained on structured clinical and behavioral data.
- âœ… **Computer Vision (CV)** models using facial image classification via deep learning.
